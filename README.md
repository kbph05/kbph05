## Hi, I’m @kbph05

  I am a second year Computer Engineering student at Simon Fraser University. Most of my experience is with C++ and Java, however I also know Python and VHDL.
  Fun fact: I enjoy self-repairing computers, where I am currently rebuilding an iMac for linux. I also have a hobby for water skiing and clarinet.
