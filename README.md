## About me
I am a second year Computer Engineering student at Simon Fraser University. Most of my experience is with C++, Matlab and Java, however I also know Python, VHDL, and HTML/CSS.

I enjoy self-repairing computers, where I am currently rebuilding a recycled Windows desktop using new and old spare computer parts. Outside of the digital world, I have a hobby for water skiing and the clarinet.
