## About me
I am a second year Computer Engineering student. Most of my experience is with C/C++, Matlab and Java, however I also know Python, VHDL, and HTML/CSS.

## Interests
- I enjoy self-repairing computers, where I am currently rebuilding a recycled Windows desktop using new and old spare computer parts. 
- Outside of the digital world, I have a hobby for water skiing and the clarinet.

### Requests
If you're curious about my projects, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn
