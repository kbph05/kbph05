## About me
I am a second year Computer Engineering student at Simon Fraser University. Most of my experience is with C++, Matlab and Java, however I also know Python and VHDL.

I enjoy self-repairing computers, where I am currently rebuilding an iMac and Windows desktop for Linux. I also have a hobby for water skiing and clarinet.
